# marsWeather
using NASA Insight API

jQuery file not in use. Haven't used it before so was playing around. 

Since values from the API update very irregularly (daily if not longer), I haven't used jQuery or similar, so the values will only update when the page is refreshed or revisited. 

I am currently trying to learn React.js so I can create pages like this that use an API and can update automatically.
